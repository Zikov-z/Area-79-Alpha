# Area-79   

**Enter Area-79, located in the Swiss mountains, where you will face off against strange and bizarre anomalies.**  

Area-79 was created because of the discoveries of many anomalies in Central Europe and its good location to hide from the public.  

The area was created by the demand of the O5 Council after a meeting took place with senior scientists and the council. All council members agreed except for O5-12.  

This area had a world-threatening breach in an alternate universe called **Universe-∑** after a failed termination attempt on SCP-682 backfired and SCP-682 adapted.  

The SCP Foundation used an advanced **Eigenweapon**, but after deleting SCP-682 from existence, it adapted again—and that’s when **SCP-6820** started existing. It deleted every living being from existence.  

Our main universe found out after receiving a message from Universe-∑, warning them about the mistake they had made and telling them not to repeat it.  

**Escape as a D-Class, be a guard to protect the facility, or even nuke and destroy it all.**
