## Lore 
Enter **Area-79** located at the swiss mountains where you will face off against strange and bizzare annomalies.
 
**Area-79** was created because of the discoveries of many annomalies in central europe and its good location to hide from the public.

The area was created by the demand of 05 council after a meeting took place with senior scientists and the council.
All council members agreed expect 
**05-12**.

This area had a world threating breach in an alternate universe called
"**Universe-∑**" after a failed termination attempt on **SCP-682** back fired
And **SCP-682** addapted
The SCP Foundation used an advanced eigenweapon but after deleting **SCP-682** from existence it adapted and thats when **SCP-6820** started existing it deleted every living being from existence
Our main universe found out after they got a message from the **Universe-∑**
Warning them about the mistake they had done and to not do the same mistake.
